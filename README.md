# Overview
This is a pet project to create new experience for any plays of the rogue-lite game Risk of Rain 2.

Risk of Rain has been a favorite since the first installment came out. There are many enjoyable playstyles and builds you can create in the game and it is exciting to try them all. 

This program is meant to be used with the command artifact and will provide you with random items to be used for your Risk of Rain run.

#### How to use this program:
1. Click on the "Choose your Path" button in the center of the screen. this will allow you to decide how many random item types of each rarity type you will be allowed to use. The default is 3 common, 2 uncommon, and 1 of each other type.
2. Click the "Generate Your Items" button to see your different random items.

It is as easy as that!  
Thanks for looking at my project!


Future functionality to be added:
1. Include tool tips so that you can see what an item does when it is hovered over.
2. Include an option to choose a random survivor as well.
3. Include the ability to turn off DLC items.
